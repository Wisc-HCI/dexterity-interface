It looks like you've changed the directive from controlling the robot arm. However, if you'd like to proceed with inserting a USB, here are the ranked primitives again:

1. MOVE
2. PICK
3. GRASP
4. MOVE
5. PLACE
6. RELEASE
7. RESET
8. STOP

If you want to assign a new directive or have any other questions, feel free to ask!
