# Update this file after measuring the transform from the color optical frame
# to the world frame (floor at center of the table).

  notes: "Replace with the measured transform for your camera setup."

# T_world_color maps homogeneous coordinates expressed in the color optical frame
# into the world frame. Units are meters.
